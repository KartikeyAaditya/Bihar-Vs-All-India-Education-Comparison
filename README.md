Bihar vs All India: Comparative Educational Indicators (Log Scale)
This bar chart provides a side-by-side comparison of key educational indicators between Bihar and All India averages. The use of a logarithmic scale on the y-axis allows for better visualization of disparities across wide-ranging metrics — from enrollment figures to infrastructure indicators — without distortion due to extreme values.

Each indicator has been cleaned, hierarchically grouped, and standardized to improve interpretability. For instance, sub-indicators like “- Primary” or “- Higher Secondary” are now nested under their parent categories for contextual clarity.

The chart adheres to IMF/World Bank-style standards, featuring:

A minimalist white background for a clean presentation,

Rotated axis labels for optimal space use and readability,

A horizontal legend positioned at the top-right for immediate comparison,

An embedded data source citation to ensure transparency.

Such visual representation enables quick identification of development gaps in Bihar’s education system when benchmarked against national trends, making it a powerful tool for policymakers and analysts alike.
